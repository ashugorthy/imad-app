<h3> Rhaegal </h3>
<div>

<p>
    Rhaegal is one of the three dragons born on the Dothraki Sea, along with Drogon and Viserion. He is named after Daenerys Targaryen's eldest brother, Rhaegar. He is distinguishable by his green and bronze colored scales, and his yellow-orange colored wings.
</p>
<p>
   Rhaegal has green and bronze scales.[2] His green scales are a dark green, the green of moss in the deep woods at dusk, just before the light fades, and they gleam like jade. His teeth and claws are black. [3] His eyes are bronze, brighter than polished shields, and they glow with their own heat. His flame is orange-and-yellow fire shot through with veins of green.
