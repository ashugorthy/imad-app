<p>
    Drogon is one of the three dragons born in the Dothraki Sea, along with Rhaegal and Viserion. He is named after Daenerys's late husband Khal Drogo. He is distinguishable by his black and red colored scales, and red-black wing.

   Drogon's scales are black, his horns and spinal plates are blood red,and his eyes are smouldering red pits. His teeth are black as well. His flame is black fire shot with red and the wash of its heat can be felt thirty feet away. His wing flap sounds like the clap of thunder. He bleeds black blood.
