<h3> Drogon </h3>
<div>

<p>
    Drogon is one of the three dragons born in the Dothraki Sea, along with Rhaegal and Viserion. He is named after Daenerys's late husband Khal Drogo. He is distinguishable by his black and red colored scales, and red-black wings.
</p>
<p>
    Drogon's egg is black as the midnight sea, alive with scarlet ripples and swirls.
The maegi Mirri Maz Duur proclaims that in order to bring new life one must give life. Daenerys Targaryen burns the body of her deceased husband, Khal Drogo, along with Mirri Maz Duur herself and the three eggs, giving life to Drogon and his brothers, Viserion and Rhaegal.
